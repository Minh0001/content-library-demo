## [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
    Quickly and effortlessly setup a new react project from existing template.

## [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

> The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
> 
> "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
> "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
> "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
> We can't solve every use case, but in the spirit of create-react-app and apollo-boost, we can try to provide some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.
> 
> Because of that, this package is deliberately limited in scope. It does not address concepts like "reusable encapsulated Redux modules", data caching, folder or file structures, managing entity relationships in the store, and so on.
> 
> That said, these tools should be beneficial to all Redux users. Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to simplify an existing application, Redux Toolkit can help you make your Redux code better.
